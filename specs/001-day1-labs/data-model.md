# Data Model – Day 1 Labs Assets

## Overview

The Day 1 curriculum distributes three primary resource bundles—learner lab package, instructor demo kit, and diagnostics artifact—each with traceable versions so cohorts and support staff stay in sync.

## Entities

### LearnerLabPackage

- **Description**: Complete Day 1 deliverable provided to learners.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `version` (semver string) – aligns with course release.
  - `labs` (list of `LabModuleRef`) – references individual lab modules and their assets.
  - `verificationScripts` (list of `PathRef`) – executable checks for environment and lab success.
  - `expectedOutputs` (list of `ArtifactRef`) – canonical results learners compare against.
  - `platformSupport` (set of `PlatformCode`) – supported OS targets.
- **Relationships**:
  - Aggregates multiple **LabModuleRef** records drawn from `day-1/labs/*`.
  - Shares assets with **InstructorDemoKit** to guarantee parity.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Must include all three lab modules (`lab-01`, `lab-02`, `lab-03`).
  - Verification scripts must be executable on listed platforms.

### InstructorDemoKit

- **Description**: Rehearsed demos, transcripts, and recordings for instructors.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `version` (semver string) – mirrors LearnerLabPackage.
  - `runbooks` (list of `RunbookRef`) – ordered walkthroughs with timestamps and checkpoints.
  - `recordings` (list of `MediaRef`) – optional video/audio assets.
  - `slideDeck` (`PathRef`) – slides aligned with lectures/labs.
  - `supportingScripts` (list of `PathRef`) – command snippets executed during demos.
- **Relationships**:
  - Reuses verification scripts and expected outputs from **LearnerLabPackage**.
  - References troubleshooting entries maintained in **DiagnosticsArtifact**.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Every runbook must cite at least one verification checkpoint.
  - Slide deck and runbooks must share the same version tag.

### DiagnosticsArtifact

- **Description**: Support-facing collection of logs, health reports, and remediation notes.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `issueMatrix` (list of `IssueEntry`) – mapping of symptom → probable cause → fix.
  - `sampleLogs` (list of `ArtifactRef`) – canonical outputs from verification scripts.
  - `escalationGuidelines` (`PathRef`) – when to involve engineering.
  - `tooling` (list of `PathRef`) – scripts capturing diagnostics (e.g., `verify-environment.sh`).
- **Relationships**:
  - Consumes outputs generated by **LearnerLabPackage** verification scripts.
  - Provides references used in **InstructorDemoKit** runbooks for failure demos.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Each issue entry must link to at least one script or command that confirms remediation.
  - Versions must stay aligned with LearnerLabPackage and InstructorDemoKit.

### Supporting Value Objects

- **LabModuleRef**: `{ id, name, description, guidePath, assets (list of PathRef) }`
- **RunbookRef**: `{ id, title, scenario, checkpoints (list of Checkpoint) }`
- **ArtifactRef**: `{ path, checksum, generatedBy }`
- **IssueEntry**: `{ id, symptom, probableCause, resolutionSteps (list of string), verificationCommand }`
- **PlatformCode**: Enum `{ macos, ubuntu, wsl2 }`
- **Checkpoint**: `{ order, command, expectedOutput, fallback }`

## State Transitions

- **Draft → Reviewed**: Assets drafted, validated internally, awaiting instructor sign-off.
- **Reviewed → Published**: Version tagged, uploaded to distribution channel, announcement sent to cohort.
- **Published → Deprecated**: Superseded by newer release; retained for audit but not delivered to new cohorts.

Transitions apply across LearnerLabPackage, InstructorDemoKit, and DiagnosticsArtifact simultaneously to keep bundles consistent.
