# Feature Specification: Day 1 Labs – Complete Implementation & Demo Assets

**Feature Branch**: `001-day1-labs`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement day01 all labs with full code and demos"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Learner completes Day 1 independently (Priority: P1)

An enrolled learner follows the Day 1 curriculum and uses the provided lab materials to set up the environment, build the first MCP server, and instrument metrics without instructor intervention.

**Why this priority**: Learner self-sufficiency is the core objective of Day 1; if learners cannot progress solo, the curriculum fails its primary goal.

**Independent Test**: Provide the learner package to a pilot student, time their run-through, and confirm they finish all labs without requesting additional assets or support beyond the documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean workstation that meets listed prerequisites, **When** the learner executes the automated setup instructions, **Then** the environment is fully provisioned and verified on the first attempt.
2. **Given** the learner has completed environment setup, **When** they follow Lab 2 instructions, **Then** a working MCP server with the expected behaviors is deployed and passes the included test steps.

### User Story 2 - Instructor delivers a live demo (Priority: P2)

An instructor uses the provided demo scripts and datasets to showcase key checkpoints from each lab during a live or recorded session, highlighting expected outputs and troubleshooting steps.

**Why this priority**: Consistent demos ensure cohorts receive the same quality walkthrough and reduce prep time for instructors.

**Independent Test**: Instructor follows the demo playbook, replicates scripted checkpoints in a staging environment, and captures screenshots or recordings without improvising additional setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the instructor opens the demo outline, **When** they execute the listed commands, **Then** each milestone (e.g., cluster verification, tool invocation) produces the documented output.
2. **Given** demo assets are available, **When** a learner requests a replay, **Then** the instructor can provide the prepared recording or slide deck without re-running live steps.

### User Story 3 - Support staff troubleshoot learner issues (Priority: P3)

Support personnel reference the lab guides, validation scripts, and troubleshooting appendix to diagnose and resolve learner-reported issues tied to Day 1 labs.

**Why this priority**: Efficient support keeps learners on track and prevents schedule slippage across later days.

**Independent Test**: Provide a simulated support ticket (e.g., monitoring stack failing to deploy); confirm support staff can reproduce the situation using the demo assets and apply documented resolution steps within defined SLAs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner submits diagnostics produced by verification scripts, **When** support staff compare results with the troubleshooting matrix, **Then** they identify likely causes and recommended fixes.

### Edge Cases

- Environment setup attempted on machines lacking virtualization support or with restricted corporate policies.
- Learners running labs with intermittent connectivity or behind strict proxies.
- Demo executions that start from partially completed states (e.g., cluster half-created) or after a prior failed attempt.
- Metrics lab executed on limited-resource hardware that cannot sustain default retention values.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Provide a unified Day 1 learner package containing updated READMEs, step-by-step instructions, and verification checklists for all labs.
- **FR-002**: Supply fully automated environment setup assets, including scripts and configuration files, with documented prerequisites and rollback steps.
- **FR-003**: Deliver a reference MCP server project aligned with Lab 2 objectives, featuring illustrative tools, logging guidance, and testing instructions.
- **FR-004**: Include a metrics implementation kit for Lab 3 that exposes sample metrics, scraping configuration, visualization templates, and alert examples.
- **FR-005**: Produce instructor demo assets (run-through guides, command transcripts, slide snippets, and recording notes) covering key milestones across Day 1.
- **FR-006**: Publish troubleshooting guidance and diagnostics scripts that map common failure modes to corrective actions for each lab.
- **FR-007**: Ensure all assets are versioned, platform-agnostic across macOS/Linux/WSL2, and reference validated outputs so learners can self-check progress.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Learner Lab Package**: Consolidated set of lab guides, automation scripts, validation checklists, and expected outputs distributed to Day 1 participants.
- **Instructor Demo Kit**: Curated scenarios, scripted commands, and media assets that instructors use for live or asynchronous demonstrations.
- **Diagnostics Artifact**: Logs, verification script outputs, and issue matrices generated by learners and consumed by support staff for troubleshooting.

### Assumptions & Dependencies

- Learners have access to macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2 devices that meet the published hardware requirements (≥8 GB RAM, ≥20 GB free disk, stable internet).
- Networking policies permit container downloads and access to GitHub/Helm registries; offline or air-gapped flows are out of scope for Day 1.
- Demo recordings can reuse the same environments defined for learners; no separate cloud tenancy is required.
- Future curriculum days may reference these assets; versioning must remain backward-compatible or include migration notes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least 90% of pilot learners complete all three Day 1 labs, including validations, within the scheduled class time (≤8 hours) using only provided assets.
- **SC-002**: Instructors can run the full demo sequence end-to-end in under 45 minutes with zero undocumented steps or manual fixes.
- **SC-003**: Support staff resolve simulated learner issues using the troubleshooting guidance in ≤30 minutes for 95% of common failure scenarios.
- **SC-004**: Learner satisfaction survey scores for Day 1 labs reach ≥4.5/5 for clarity of instructions and availability of working examples.
